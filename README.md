None needed beyond the basics.

## What the Project Does
The program uses the Wufoo API to get the entries data from a Wufoo form (e.g., [CUBES Project Proposal Submission](https://mbui.wufoo.com/forms/cubes-project-proposal-submission)) by sending an HTTP GET request, converting the HTTP GET response into JSON, and saving the entries to a text file.

## What Is Missing from the Project
