## Maria Bui

## Install and Run Directions
None needed beyond the basics.

## What the Project Does
The program uses my API key to get the entries data from my CUBES Project Proposal Submission Wufoo form (https://mbui.wufoo.com/forms/cubes-project-proposal-submission) by sending an HTTP GET request, decoding the HTTP GET response into JSON, and saving the entries to a text file.

## What Is Missing from the Project
None.
